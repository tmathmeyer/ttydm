TTYDM
=====

A simple "display manager" that runs on boot instead of getty in one of
your vtty's


CONFIGURATION
=============

all relevant files are in /etc/ttydm/
 - bg.bmp : drawn in the background, should be equal to the dimensions of your
   monitor
 - [username]*.bmp : the presence of a 150x150px image signifies that "username"
   has a profile in ttydm. This image is also drawn above the password field.
 - [username]*/init.sh : this shell script is run when the user logs in

INSTALLATION
============

run ```make``` as your normal user, then run ```make install``` as root. The
binaries and init scripts for 'user' will be added to ```/usr/local/bin/``` and
```/etc/ttydm/``` respectively. You will need to move the
```/etc/ttydm/user*``` to ```/etc/ttydm/[your username]```. You should also
enable ttydm.service with systemd.
